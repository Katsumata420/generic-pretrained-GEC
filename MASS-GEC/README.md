## How To Run
### English GEC
- Move to `MASS-summarization` dir.
  - Because
    - We use the `MASS-middle-uncased` model for English GEC.
    - This model can be used in that dir.

### German GEC
- Move to `MASS-unsupNMT` dir.
  - Because
    - We use the `mass_ende_1024` model for German GEC.
    - This model can be used in that dir.
